    In summer 2018, I joined Computer Aided Medical Procedures ([CAMP](http://campar.in.tum.de)), as an intern 
    under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab), at Technical University of Munich (TUM).
    I started to study the recently emerging topic of Geometric Deep Learning. My first major involvement involvement with the team was 
    on a research project aiming to address the problem of semi-supervised disease prediction in a multi-modal setting, when the 
    dataset comprises of both imaging and non-imaging data. This work was published in the proceedings of the 
    **IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)**, and was presented as an **oral contribution**.
  
    In another research project, I investigated how changing the receptive field size in GCN alters its overall performance.
    Accordingly, we designed a novel method called InceptionGCN utilizing inception modules, where each module has a different kernel size.
    The result of this study is now published and accepted for **oral presentation (with 7% acceptance rate)** in the conference of **Information 
    Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI 2019)**.
    
    As continuation of my work on the first paper, I committed to a remote collaboration with CAMP on another project in which 
    our team incorporated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based attention mechanism into GCN to make patient-specific 
    disease predictions. This work also resulted in a paper published in the International Conference on **Medical Image Computing 
    and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2019)**.
    
    In summer 2019, I rejoined CAMP, but this time I took the initiative and identified the problem of automatically learning the 
    receptive field size in GCNs as an open problem. I proposed a new model capable of **adaptively learning the receptive field size 
    in an end-to-end manner**. Later, I realized that my model has direct applications to 3D shape analysis tasks such as 
    mesh regression and shape correspondence.

    I joined a project on single-cell transcriptomics under the supervision of Dr. Laleh Haghverdi, winner of an Erwin Schrödinger Prize. 
    Most of the existing single-cell classification methods take genes as independent features to assign cell types disregarding their interactions, 
    which has been shown to be of great importance in cellular processes. 
    We introduced **single-cell Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN)**, which takes gene-gene interactions into account 
    by constructing a co-expression network of a subset of genes. The results of this work were presented as a poster 
    in the **ISMB/ECCB 2019 conference**.

    As part of my Bachelor Thesis, I worked under supervision of [Dr. Soleymani](http://sharif.edu/~soleymani/) on **Graph Learning in Heterogenous Networks**.
    In this project, I have proposed and implemented a novel Autoencoder approach to efficiently solve the problem of 
    link prediction in networks with diversity in nodes.

    [DataDays](http://datadays.sharif.edu/) was the **First National Data Scientific Competition** held 
    by Sharif University of Technology.
    Its main goal was to broaden appeal for working on problems related to data. 
    Moreover, it is a large-scale attempt to assess the level of knowledge in this field in Iran.
    
    As a volunteer, I joined the Scientific Staff and help them to propose questions which could be solved by Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods.
    In addition, we developed some [Perisan Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/datadays-content/datadays-content.github.io) as tutorials mostly related 
    to Data Analysis and Machine Learning. We made it accessible to all the teams in order to encourage them to raise their skill and knowledge in these fields. 
    
    The whole competition was centered around working on a dataset collected by [Cafebazaar](https://cafebazaar.ir/) from [Divar](http://divar.ir).
    This dataset mainly comprises online advertisements published by people in different categories.

    During summer of 2017, I worked for a start-up called [Yektanet](https://www.yektanet.com/), an online advertisement platform in my country. 
    This platform is basically publishing advertisements on well-known publishers for achieving clicks and views. 
    I was employed as data scientist and developed algorithms **determining the subject of web pages using their textual data**. 
    They are now deployed for displaying relevant items of advertisement on each webpage.
