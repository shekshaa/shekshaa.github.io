    During the summer of 2018, I worked as a research intern in the Computer Aided Medical Procedures and Augmented Reality Lab (CAMPAR), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab, at Technical University of Munich (TUM).
    From September 2018, I started my collaboration with my advisor remotely.
    
    My research centered around Deep Learning on Graphs. We developed and applied various visualization methods over different state-of-the-art architectures of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks, in order to investigate the characteristics and behavior of these architectures. 
    
    Based on the insight gained from these visualizations, we proposed new architectures that were applied to medical datasets. 
    The initial results of this study are now published and accepted for oral presentation in IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019). 
    Furthermore, we proposed a novel architecture called InceptionGCN addressing the problem of manually setting neighborhood size of nodes. 
    It is published in a new paper accepted for oral presentation (7% acceptance rate) in international conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI 2019).

    I have started to work on research two projects at MLL lab under supervision of Dr. Soleymani:
    
    Goal of the first one is to analyze mammograms of a locally collected dataset by deep learning methods detecting clusters of micro-calcification in mammograms with high quality. 
    
    Recenlty, I have also started another new project on a publicly available EEG data to classify subjects based on their arrousal using signals. 
    Our main approach is to solve this problem using multilayered graph convolutional networks.

    This was the first data scientific event held by sharif university consists of different levels and stages. 
    Its main goal was to broaden appeal for working on problems related to data. 
    Moreover, it is a large-scale attempt to assess the level of knowledge in this field in Iran.
    
    I joined Scientific Staff and help them to propose questions which could be solved Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods.
    The whole competition was centered around working on a dataset collected by [Cafebazaar](https://cafebazaar.ir/) from [Divar](http://divar.ir).
    This dataset mainly comprises online advertisements published by people in different categories.

    During summer of 2017, I worked for a start-up called Yektanet, an online advertisement platform in my country. 
    This platform is basically publishing advertisements on well-known publishers for achieving clicks and views. 
    I was employed as data scientist and developed algorithms determining the subject of web pages based on their main textual data. 
    They are now deployed for displaying relevant items of advertisement on each webpage.
