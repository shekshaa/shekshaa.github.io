    **InceptionGCN: Receptive Field Aware Graph Convolutional Network for Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain architecture for deep learning on graphs for disease prediction. 
    The novelty lies in defining geometric **Inception Modules** which are capable of capturing intra and inter-graph structural heterogeneity during convolutions. 
    We design filters with different kernel sizes to build our architecture.

    **Self-Attention Equipped Graph Convolutions For Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Multi-modal data comprising imaging (MRI, fMRI, etc.) and non-imaging (demographics, etc.) data can be collected together and used for disease prediction. 
    A model capable of leveraging the individuality of each multi-modal data is required for better disease prediction. 
    We propose a graph convolution based deep model which takes into account the distinctiveness of each element of the multi-modal data. 
    We incorporate a novel **Self-Attention Layer**, which weights every element of the demographic data 
    by exploring its relation to the underlying disease.
