    ## **Cell type identification in single-cell RNA sequencing based on gene interaction networks**
    
    ---
    
    Current single-cell classification methods take genes as independent features to assign cell types disregarding
    their interactome which has been shown to be of great importance in cellular processes. Here, we introduce 
    **single-cell Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN)** which takes gene-gene interactions into account by constructing
    a co-expression network of a subset of genes and uses a graph deep learning approach to classify single-cells.

    ## **Graph Convolution Based Attention Model for Personalized Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Often a varied order of importance for the multi-modal heterogeneous data is considered for personalized disease diagnosis decisions.
    Towards this, we introduce a model which not only improves the disease prediction but also focuses on 
    learning **patient-specific** order of importance for multi-modal data elements. 
    In order to achieve this, we take advantage of **LSTM-based attention mechanism** and **graph convolutional networks (GCNs)**
    to design our model. GCNs learn multi-modal but class-specific features from the entire population of patients, 
    whereas the attention mechanism optimally fuses these multi-modal features into a final decision, separately for each patient.

    ## **InceptionGCN: Receptive Field Aware Graph Convolutional Network for Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain architecture for deep learning on graphs for disease prediction. 
    The novelty lies in defining geometric **Inception Modules** which are capable of capturing intra and inter-graph structural heterogeneity during convolutions. 
    We design filters with different kernel sizes to build our architecture.

    ## **Self-Attention Equipped Graph Convolutions For Disease Prediction**
    
    ---
    
    Multi-modal data comprising imaging (MRI, fMRI, etc.) and non-imaging (demographics, etc.) data can be collected together and used for disease prediction. 
    A model capable of leveraging the individuality of each multi-modal data is required for better disease prediction. 
    We propose a graph convolution based deep model which takes into account the distinctiveness of each element of the multi-modal data. 
    We incorporate a novel **Self-Attention Layer**, which weights every element of the demographic data 
    by exploring its relation to the underlying disease.
