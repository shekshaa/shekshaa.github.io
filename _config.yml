  My name is **Shayan Shekarforoush** and I am currently studying his bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.sharif.ir).
  My research interests include Deep Learning in particular, and Machine Learning in general, with applications in Computer Vision and Graph Learning. 
  My motivation to pursue research in these areas stems from my strong desire to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating 
  both their mathematical underpinning and their practical implications in real life and in our society. 
  Although the techniques proposed in these fields have demonstrated considerable performance gain in recent years, 
  major challenges in terms of understanding their underlying mathematical foundations remain unresolved. 
  My ultimate goal in my doctoral studies is to channel such better theoretical and functional understanding of 
  these new technologies towards better practical solutions for real life problems.
